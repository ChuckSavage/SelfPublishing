SelfPublishing
==============

A C# Web-Service API Client Interface for SelfPublishing.com's Thor Storage Interface

To use you'll need a couple of external libraries, if you want to use the library as is.

I use my custom XmlLib library from here: https://github.com/ChuckSavage/XmlLib/
- Some custom XML serialization was required to handle the requests / responses

As well as ServiceStack.Net's free WebService client here: https://github.com/ServiceStackV3/ServiceStackV3 
- There's no point re-inventing the wheel when it comes to talking with Web Services, and ServiceStack is topnotch. 

You will need an Access Key available from your customer service rep at SelfPublishing.com along with your username from the customers dashboard once you have books forsale.

This library is provided AS IS. Use at your own risk.
