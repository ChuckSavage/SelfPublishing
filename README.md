SelfPublishing
==============

A C# Web-Service API Client Interface for SelfPublishing.com's Thor Storage Interface

To use you'll need a couple of external libraries, if you want to use the library as is.

I use my custom XmlLib library from here: https://github.com/ChuckSavage/XmlLib/
As well as ServiceStack.Net's free WebService client here: https://github.com/ServiceStackV3/ServiceStackV3

You will need an Access Key available from your customer service rep at SelfPublishing.com along with your username from the customers dashboard once you have books forsale.
